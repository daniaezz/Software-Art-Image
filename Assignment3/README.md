## Concept

Taking inspiration from examples of music visialisations, I wanted to create a musical visualiser that would represent all the sounds in one shape rather than represent the notes of those song like in the examples shown in class. I also wanted the user to be able to choose their own music and generate a visualisation based on their input. From there stemmed the idea to create a song-making application. The user will be able to create a song of their liking based on a set of available sounds. Each sound would have its own musical visiualisation and when combined together they would affect each other, to be seen as one rather than individual sounds. 


## Sound and Story
There are a total of 5 sounds available to the user ( 2 piano based sounds, 2 drums and a bass guitar) and they can combine them in different ways to create their own story. The only sound playing at the beginning of the application is the softer piano sound, from there the user can choose to add or remove sounds based on their liking. The story starts building up as the user experiments with different sounds and how they work together till they reach an outcome that they are satisfied with. The sounds are all constantly playing simultaneously at the start of the application and the gui controls the volume. This was done so that the music would stay in sync and to avoid having individual sounds playing off-beat. The music visualisation would appear only if the volume is greater than 0. 

## Visualisations
I chose the visualsation for each sound based on how I imagined the sound to look like. For example, the soft piano sound reminded me more of a ripple effect because of how the sound faded out. The bass sound is represented as strings because of the nature of the instrument. The snare drum sound felt sharp and a little more uncomfortable but it wasnt as prominent as the other sounds, therefore i made it so that it would create a subtle sharpness to the shape. The drums would change the colour in this arrangment (colour - white - colour - white) based on the beat of the drum. The more elaborate piano rotates the shape and adds a blur type of effect to the background. The visualisations are synced to the beat of their respective sounds to create a harmony between the visuals and the audio. I also experimented with having visualisations for the sounds independently. The snare drum would create sharp-edged polygons if the bass guitar is not playing, the piano and bass visualisations do not change and would appear regardless of the sounds playing. However the elaborate piano sound and the drums do not have their own independent visualisations and they would depend on the other sounds playing. 


To allow the user more control over the visualisations, the volume of the bass guitar selected by the user would influence the randomness of the amplitude of the curve and the volume of the of the elaborate piano affects the speed of rotation.



## Reflection
Unfortunately, it came to my attention too late that the quality of the sounds used is not the best :(( I feel like this might affect the overall experience. I am also a little disappointed by the visualisation for the “elaborate piano” as i was hoping that i would be able to represent it playing individually as well as have it change the background, i tried doing this but because of how intense the sound is, i was unable to figure out a visualtion for it that i found fitting.
