# Still

### Inspiration 

Initially I tried to experiment with how different lines can be manipulated in such a way to form different shapes that would mimic freehand drawing of blobs. However I quickly found the randomness of these shapes unappealing as they seemed to have no relation with each other. This is when I decided to look into patterns that are somewhat random yet still appear to have some sort of structure that would add a cohesive sense to the overall piece. I was inspired by geometrical patterns that involve simple shapes. I found it intriguing how simple geometrical shapes like circles and squares can be organised in such a way that they look minimalistic yet appealing and still have some sense of connection between each other.



### Algorithm

The first step to creating this algorithm was to divide the screen into a grid. Each box in this grid would have a shape that was randomly chosen within a set of shapes (circle, square, semi circle) and it would have a different colour than the rest of the grid. To create these shapes, I made a class that would have all these predefined rules that the app has to follow in order to generate this pattern. These rules were mainly set for the drawing of the semicircle. To draw the semicircle, the program would have to randomly generate an orientation for the semicircle, and depending on this orientation, a rectangle would be drawn on the second half of a circle to create the feeling of an elongated semi circle which looked more natural overall. 


### Colour Scheme

I first experimented with having some sort of analogous colour scheme, where it would be different shades of one colour (images attached below). Although this seemed more appealing than having randomly generated colours, it felt a little overwhelming and the shapes lost their borders and the main focus became the colour rather than the shapes. From there I knew that I wanted each shape to have a unique colour but I still wanted to maintain a relation between the shapes through their colours. I decided to randomly generate a hue for the colour, whilst maintaining the same saturation and brightness throughout. Picking the combination of saturation and brightness was more of a trial and error process to see what colours felt more appealing to me. I decided to go with a more pastel colour palette to make it easy on the eyes and also evoke a sense of innocence through light colours and simple shapes.  



### Composition

Overall, I found that this pattern looks best when it is presented in a square grid rather than a rectangular grid, hence I changed the screen size to be square rather than rectangular. I also found out that adding a border around the pattern made it look a lot more cohesive and easier to take in (see comparison images below). Another thing was creating a sense of connection between the blocks. To achieve this, I made it so that if there is a rectangle facing the flat side of a semicircle, then these 2 shapes should have the same colour. I felt like this connected the whole grid together rather than having it separated by invisible lines. Overall I am happy with how this project turned out and I started appreciating the beauty of minimalism more.
